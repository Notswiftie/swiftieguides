# Floor 7 mage guide - Hyperion
#### (There is also a slightly more budget version at the end without using hyp)
Recommended cata 28+, mainly for PF reasons

### [ARMOR]
- Necrotic maxor's boots [USE STORM'S BOOTS IF YOU CAN GET 500 SPEED!]
- Necrotic storm's leggings
- Loving storm's chestplate
- Necrotic wither goggles **with refrigerate, any lvl is fine**
- Bonzo mask
- Spirit mask if you'd prefer
- Alternatively, use 4/4 young but thatâ€™s slightly worse in almost every way
  - Upgrades: Wisdom 5/Last stand, hpb, basic enchants, gemstones not required.

### [EQUIPMENT]
- Implo belt and GOC, all with speed attribute and a second random attribute (whatever you want they won't affect much), and for the other two pieces, optimise them for speed (example: Blooming SA cloak and speed mp magma necklace)
- Alternatively, use blooming dungeons equip since they can be cheaper but still give some speed.

### [WEAPON]
Heroic Hyperion, with prosecute and smite 7
Don't worry about other wither blades since they essentially suck.

### [PET]
Lvl 100 Black cat pet

### [MAGICAL POWER]
As much mp as possible into *sighted* (or bizzare if you're rich but that's very unneccessary just for f7), and put as much tuning points into *speed* as possible.

### [OPTIMISATION AND PRIORITIES]
This is singlehandedly the most important part of this guide
1) 500 speed
2) Intelligience/damage
3) Second life, 100 attack speed...etc

### [LOW MP BROKIE SET]
If you're broke as SHIT and need to play f7 anyways, you can use a full set of young dragon armour to effortlessly get 500 speed anyways.

# Spirit Sceptre Midas Staff Mage guide (Pre master mode)

Mage is expensive. All you hear from pf, or from qna, or da is constant pressure on you to use a hyperion, and that's nearly 2b alone.
Then there's the gear, then the peripherals, then the pet, then the mp. Is it really that expensive to do floor 7?

SS Midas mage single handedly destroys that concept.


## Overview
SS Midas mage is fundamentally so good under a few assumptions:
- You could one tap ALL mobs in clear with the spirit sceptre with the exception of minis
- And by extension (but completely unnecessary) one tap minis with midas
- You could get 400 speed without sacrificing much stats
- You could survive

You don't *need* to hit all three of these points, but given you hit all three, SS Midas mage is theoretically faster than hyp, since you could clear as fast as hyp with the sceptre but then kill minis without a second though.

All for a fraction of the price

### What do you actually do?
Concept is simple. You just rcm with sceptre for all trash mobs pointing straight down (in 3rd person view) with movement reliant on walking (therefore importance of 400/500 speed), but with minis, you rcm them with a midas staff and even lcm it for extra damage if you need. (Hence t6 enchants and first strike on midas staff)

## Setup

### Armor
Necrotic wither goggles
Loving Storm's chestplate
Necrotic Storm's leggings
Necrotic Maxor's boots (You can either use one, two, or zero piece maxor in order to hit 400 speed.)

### Upgrades
- Hot potato books
- T5 enchants
- Wisdom 5
- Recomb
- Rejuvenate 5

### Weapon
Gilded Midas Staff
- 100M staff is enough, but spending more may make one tapping minis easier which can shave off valuable time 

Heroic Spirit Sceptre

### Upgrades
Smite 7
Prosecute
First strike (especially important on midas staff)
All T6 enchants (T7 if affordable) for lcm on midas staff

### Other pieces of gear (Utilities not included)
Lvl 100 legendary sheep pet with shelmet
For F7 boss: (Or clear if you do enough damage) Lvl 100 black cat pet with shelmet
Rogue sword if needed

### Optimisation
1) 400 speed (Absolutely critical) - the main sources of this would be your base stats (i.e. skills), maxor pieces if you have them, tuning points, and rogue sword.
2) High intelligience - the higher the better - this setup works SO much better when you can one tap things without second thoughts and avoiding backtracking. (This goes for both the stats and you)
3) Survivability and everything else
