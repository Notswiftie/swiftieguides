# PRE MM ARCHER GUIDE
This guide is aimed at players with a f7 completion, refer to the bottom for those without.

### [ARMOR]
- Renowned terror boots*
- Renowned terror leggings
- Ancient maxor’s leggings and necron's chestplate (use an extra renowned piece if your attack speed or mp is that bad)
- Ancient golden head for whatever floor you’re doing
- Max end shop two headed strike perk to buff renowned. It will give 28 attack speed if you use renowned terror 2 piece.
  Upgrades on necron: Legion 3, gemstones if can afford, recomb, hot potatos, and basic enchants.
  Upgrades on terror: Legion 3, speed 5+, renowned with maxed two headed strike
  (See end note and pets for alternatives)

*Terror is FANTASTIC dps and clear speed at the cost of ehp. Optimally, you should use two piece terror in clear and one piece in boss. (There are floppy arrows with one piece which makes it bad in clear). Otherwise, just use a conventional maxor boot/necron legs setup.

    <summary> Why is terror so good? </summary>
<p>

**Why terror?**

2 piece terror increases clear speed a lot - technically and theoretically better than term (assuming one tap), since you have a wider arrow spread PLUS the juju perk (3 enemies hit at once). Two piece terror is needed here since one piece terror has floppy side arrows which is obviously no good in clear.

Therefore, in dps only situations like f7 boss, **one piece terror will be better.** Terror is additive +2 arrows, and it is better than 3/4 necron in M7 with hypermaxed gear, term, +0.2 arrows from duplex, and +1.7 arrows from archer perk, which should dilute the terror perk, but terror is still better dps. Terror is also +100% additive damage (although I cannot guarantee if that works). By that logic, and by testing of me and many other players, one piece terror (and even two piece by extention) is vastly superior to 1/2 necron + maxor boots juju damage.

*One piece terror only works in situations with no arrow stack or short arrow stacks. In m7 phase 5 or f6/m6 giants, you need two piece or no terror, since arrows have a long travel distance

Downside: EHP - that's it. If you can overcome the ehp issue, terror is the dream build for you (Fast ass clear, satisfying ass clear, insane dps). And ehp shouldn't be the reason you stray away from a set, but you do you!

### [EQUIPMENT]
- Bone necklace, Shadow Assassin cloak, and Adaptive belt all reforged to blooming(blended if you don't get 100 attack speed). Frag them where applicable
- Gauntlet of contagion with speed attribute (dw about the other one).

### [WEAPON]
Juju shortbow - needs se3+, ov5, p6 and all the other random misc enchants. Precise 5* fuming etc.

### [PET]
There are two main choices for archer: Skeleton + Wither skelly, or zombie + wither skelly.
They are both better damage than FB and edrag.
Skeleton is good damage on all mobs, but is very glass cannon (150% more damage, no ehp).
Wither skelly is VERY good dps on withers and wither skeletons (125% more damage, + 1/3 hit's worth of damage per second) and good ehp.


### [MAGICAL POWER]
The higher the better. Since you will be using only two pieces of renowned at a time, 938 mp is needed to get 100 attack speed off itchy and renowned alone.
Another option is to use beacons, enrichments, and some tunings to get to 100. Or use a third piece of renowned but that could be a huge damage loss.
**LESS MP IS PERFECTLY FINE ASSUMING YOU GET 100 ATTACK SPEED**

[Optimisation]
100 attack speed -> Obtain this through renowned, itchy reforge, enrichments, beacon, and tunings (in roughly this order)
400 speed -> Speed 5 on terror, tunings, rogue sword, upgraded/prestiged terror

Changes players w/o f7 comp or money: Use 4/4 skeleton master (50% Stat boost - ask someone or use a mod if you don't know what it is, dropped from the highest floor you've completed), (or shadow assassin armour) with a skeleton pet, or 3/4 skelemaster with ghead and skeleton.
