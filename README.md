# Swiftie Guides

This repo is a collection of all of my guides in skyblock - I absolutely cannot guarantee that they are up to date, but they are, (generally), as far as I know, the best written guides there are in skyblock, by straying away from mainstream metas and diving into niche but hyperoptimised strategies that can make the difference between you and party finder.
