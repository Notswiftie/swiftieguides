# What makes true bers so viable in master mode? (Compared to term)

## Introduction
_The aim of this piece isn't to prove that true bers is **better** than terminator - that wouldn't be possible simply for the dps aspect, but rather to prove that claymore or giant's sword bers is a PERFECTLY viable alternative to terminator in M3-6 where dps isn't nearly as important of a factor._

The majority of this piece would be written on the absolutely dominant (theory wise) clear speed of true bers, and a more minor second part would be on why it would be viable cost and damage wise.
### Firstly, let's break down the benefits and disadvantages of terminator**

**Positives**
- Long range
- High damage (more specifically dps)
  - Also procs bers passive faster - dps ramps up rapidly
- Decent angular size (compared to juju)

**Negatives**
- Low angular size (compared to true bers)
- Expensive as piss
- Very prone to lag
- Arrow delay
- Horrible one tap damage
- Shoots only 5 volleys of arrows per second max
  Main weakness: Against fast moving mobs at point blank range
### Additionally, true bers.

**Positives**
- Bad range (~+10 blocks with dupe bers)
- Bad damage (very specifically dps)

**Negatives**
+ HUGE angular size
+ No delay
+ Casts a damage cone up to 20 times a second
+ Cheap as shit

### Finally, to understand how each attack method works
Terminator fires [Attack speed - usually 5] volleys of 3 arrows per second, totalling to 15 arrows per second. The arrows are spread at a 5 degree angle skewed from the center arrow, and each arrow has a hitbox size of 0.5*0.5 blocks

True bers casts a cone with angular size of ~45 to 60 degrees (I cannot give you an exact number - there is currently NO way to accurately test it in dungeons since no mobs are fixed spawn and no movement) and [Swing range] length whenever you left click, (This could be triggered by mining blocks too) rounded to the nearest tick.

An easy way to understand this is to imagine a circle of 45 degrees on your screen (i.e. occupies an eighth of the space around you), and whenever you click, every single mob who has their hitbox in that circle AND is within [Swing range] blocks takes damage.

Attack speed plays the role by the number of frames during which the mob cannot be damaged by you again - i.e. invincibility frames. An attack speed of 82 gives the mob only 5 ticks of invincibility frames, so you could deal damage to him again in 1/4 of a second. (I.e. 4 swings of damage per second)

With that aside, let's compare each aspect of these two weapons, and why claymore bers is AT LEAST equally as competent if not better than term in lower mm floors (M3 and M5).

## Arguments

### 1. Clear speed -> Angular size.
The first and greatest aspect by which claymore is fantastic over term, is its angular size. I previously defined angular size as the diameter of the area on your screen where a mob will be registered as hit once you do the attack.
For instance, the bers attack cone has an angular size of 45 degrees, since it casts a very simple cone.

The angular size is quite a bit more complicated for term. For each arrow, It could be calculated fairly easily using the equation: angular size = arctan (arrow length/distance). Since the arrow has a length of 0.5 blocks (by 0.5 blocks), it produces a graph like this - the angular size decreases dramatically the further away the arrows are. [Angular size decrease graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xoc5mni92c)

It's of course impossible to ignore the side arrows, which are spread aside at 5 degrees, and that since any contact between the hitbox of the arrow and the mob causes damage to proc, it actually has a decent angular size AT CLOSE RANGE (imagine the webbed feet of a duck, kinda) as the hitbox of the mob helps contribute to cover the gap between arrows. This is actually the reason why term is so dominant over juju.

However, as distance increase and the gaps between the arrows, as well as the angular size of each arrow, decreases, the effective angular size of term has a HUGE dropoff at longer distances, making it identical to juju in that you have to aim at specific mobs, and I have an entire thread on why juju gets completely bummed by true bers. Bol vs Juju SBZ post
Oh not to mention that the term arrow is spread flat rather than vertically too, and it STILL covers much less angular size than true bers.

So let's imagine an example here of a strafing zombie commander (at point blank range). (Red guys with rods and a piss ton of health) - because there is a MUCH greater region around your cursor where the mob would still be damaged, your mouse could be like half the screen away from the zombie commander and it would still get hit. Contrast that with the term, where you have to account for a much smaller angular size AND arrow travel time, making not only your aim a massively important factor, but also your ping.

The conclusion for this section is that bers deals damage to a MUCH larger area of your screen. The effect to that is the following:
1) It allows you to clear a much larger patch of enemies at once (not to mention with true bers, if you don't hit the mob initially, you can always swing your camera and then hit it).
2) It is much easier to deal with mobs at point blank range with very high angular velocities (moving across your screen very quickly)
3) Lag plays less of a role because the mob is more likely to still be in the imaginary damage cone after the server registers that you clicked.

### 2. Clear speed -> Attack refresh rate.
As I mentioned in the mechanics section, arch only fires arrows 5 times a second, whilst true bers casts a projection 20 times a second.

However, I missed out on a very important point - the 5 volleys per second happens at FIXED intervals (i.e. a necessary cooldown of 0.2 seconds before you could cast the next shot), whilst this fixed interval effect is negligible on true bers due to the cooldown of only 0.05s (the rate at which the game fucking runs - it's not possible to be faster than that).

Let's go back to our example of the strafing zombie commander at point blank range. Assuming that you miss the first shot of term, you would need to wait for at least 0.2 seconds before casting the next shot, during which time you have to CONSTANTLY have your mouse cursor tracking over where you PREDICT the zombie commander would be after arrow travel time, since you cannot comprehend or control exactly when the arrow is fired next. This is simply exhausting - in fact, you would most likely miss your second, or third, or fourth shot, causing you to spend upwards of a second (or even more depending on how unconcentrated or unlucky you are).

For true bers, however, not only can you place your next "shot" instantly (if you even miss your first hit), there is zero delay. So given that you will almost certainly not even miss the first hit, you are GUARANTEED to hit your second unless you're genuinely shit, whilst with term, you have to constantly track the mob, predict its movement AND account for ping.

Once again, true bers is completely dominant over term in this aspect for the reason that you can "fire a shot" immediately after missing (if you even do) without needing to constantly track where the mob *would be* after a time delay dependent on your distance over a time period of over 0.2 seconds.

#### SKILL ISSUE!?
I could already tell that some people are going to argue "SKILL ISSUE!!!", however, with any second of thought anyone'd realise why that's a horribly unsupported argument - ANYTHING you could compensate on term skill wise, you'd employ it better on true bers. Hell, if you really wanted to bank on the skill scarecrow, you'd argue that true bers clears faster than hype because you could spin around in a circle with a radius of 15 blocks. You see how ridiculous "SKILL ISSUE" is?

### 3. Clear speed -> Arrow flight time
We need a new definition here (mentioned slightly previously): Angular velocity - the distance it travels across your screen in degrees. Closer objects traveling at the same speed has a higher angular velocity (think of it like trees in the foreground and mountains in the background on a car or train ride - they both travel at the same speed relative to you, but trees appear to move across your eyes much faster)
Applied in minecraft, a mob with the same walking speed moves MUCH faster across your screen the closer it is to you.

Luckily for us, angular velocity doesn't matter at all if your attack is applied instantly. Afterall, distance traveled = 0 if time = 0, right?

Unluckily for us, the attack is never applied instantly. There are two main factors to this: Ping, and arrow flight time.
Modeling the time delay of arrows isn't easy - they have an initial velocity of 3 blocks per tick, and it deteriorates by 1% per tick indefinitely (in the horizontal direction) - it is a logarithmic function effectively, and integrating is outside of my gcse knowledge ;-;.
Anyways here's a calculator I made which gives the time delay in milliseconds accounting for both ping and arrow delay depending on the distance. Total attack delay calculator

As you could see, assuming an average ping of 150ms, an arrow travel time delay of 84ms is absolutely detrimental, increasing the total delay by nearly 40%.

What's the effect of this?
Let's say the mob has an angular velocity of 45 degrees per second (5 blocks per second at 5 blocks away). With true bers, you need to aim 6.75 degrees ahead (not accounting for cones), whilst with term, you have to aim 10.5 degrees ahead - a huge amount more. This isn't even considering that the angular size of term is SO much lower, so in reality you'd have to track much further ahead and MUCH more accurately.

How does this apply?
Let's come back to the strafing zombie commander example again at 5 blocks away, traveling at a speed of 5 blocks per second (roughly 100 speed) With term, assuming you're using the widest areas of the angular size (i.e. side arrows), you'd still need to move your camera by 5 degrees from where the mob is currently  (which is a 20th of your screen roughly) assuming you have PERFECT movement and no undershots, not to mention this must be timed perfectly with the term's 0.2s cooldown.

With bers, however, not only do you not need to move your cursor ahead of the monster at all, youd actually be able to move your curser AWAY from the monster by 16 degrees, a fifth of your fucking screen. This perfectly encapsulates how ridiculously OP true bers is despite the tiny tiny margins (in cooperation with its huge angular size)


### 4. Range
Wow. Range. Surely this must help the term right?
This thread is purely to argue why range does not matter at all, for a few reasons.
Fels are waken at a range of 2 blocks (once again there's not a single fucking source on the internet for this and my account is locked - but the exact range doesnt matter), and they are also spawned at random locations at where mobs could spawn. This means, that unless you simultaneously BOTH used cheats (esp on starred mobs) AND focus on where fels are in order to skip all spawns without fels, you are by necessity forced to visit every single possible spawn location to a point blank range, which we've previously explained term is horrible for in every way.

Furthermore, term is absolutely shit at a longer range, explained in both point 1 and 3. Summary:
- Term angular size decreases DRASTICALLY at longer ranges, behaving exactly like a juju. As the arrow travels away, mob hitboxes are less likely to be trapped within the hitboxes of the arrows, and the angular size of the arrows AND the mobs decreases too. Basically, shooting monsters at long range requires highly precise aim. This time, not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction due to how small the monsters are.
- However, whilst arrow time delay at these distances would more than triple the total delay, it shouldn't play a major part since these monsters won't be moving and arrows travel independently to you.

Therefore, the argument that "term" is ranged stands NO ground - it clears equally horribly, actually does worse dps now, and you're gonna have to go to every location anyways.


### 5. Damage
Very short section here, but an se clay could one tap every single normal mob whilst an se term cant - this is quite important in master mode, since mobs actually do have substantial health and the ability to move on after aiming at a single pack of mobs is hugely beneficial.

### 6. Cost
Probably the most important section for many people - a cheap, soul eater claymore would cost probably just over 200M coins, whilst a terminator would cost 600-700m at least for a decent one.

Furthermore, there's magical power.
Claymore only needs 407 magical power if you use two pieces of renowned armour, and 777 if you use one piece, **(EVEN LESS IF YOU USE MASTER STARS!** whilst term needs well over 700 (maybe even 800) just to get 100 crit chance on precise, not to mention the fact that overload means there's no limit to how much mp you'll need. _(Keep in mind term will still need at least one piece of renowned since 100 attack speed is really hard to get on skeleton pet without using tunings)_

Yeah, claymore is a lot cheaper. A lot.
### 7. Arguments against claymore
1) DPS. Yeah, fairs. Especially considering arrow stack can give a lot of dps, term has a pretty large dps advantage on minis. However, bers does have the bers ultimate which gives a huge boost in dps.
2) Bouncy arrows: People grossly overstate the usefulness of them, for two main reasons: You could NEVER rely on them, since there's a 50% bounce chance, and each bounce does 15% less damage. Furthermore, these arrows only have a CHANCE of bouncing if you get a single hit on the mob, which could be a challenge compared to claymore.
3) GOC: Exact same weakness as bouncy - has to get a hit in first




## So how should you use claymore? (Final verdict)
We've already established that claymore clears much better than term in every way theoretically - even if that isn't enough to persuade you, claymore is definitely more than competent or close enough to term to act as an alternative.
However, it's also absolutely clear that term does more dps, which makes true bers absolutely not viable anywhere where bers dps actually matters, which is, in reality, only m7. (Maybe m4)

Dps does become an issue though, in clear - sometimes, you just don't do enough damage against minibosses. In my own testing I've found that not to be a huge issue somehow compared to term, but you should come to your own conclusions for this. (This test is slightly biased against claymore, because I have 1500mp, which means my overload chance benefits term MUCH more than claymore)

_Footnote: It is not possible to tiebreak via an in game test, as there is no way to do accurate clear speed tests due to the huge amount of factors in experience, room generation, small choices, luck...etc that cannot be fixed without forcing a person to do millions of runs whilst making sure their clear style never changes._

</details>

### [ARMOR]
- Maxor’s boots
- Necron’s leggings and chest plate
- Golden head for whatever floor you’re doing
- Max end shop two headed strike perk to buff renowned. It will give 42 attack speed on helmet alone.
  Upgrades: Legion 3, gemstones if can afford, recomb, hot potatos, and basic enchants.
- Reforge: Two pieces of renowned on armour pieces, but the golden head has to be ancient. 

### [EQUIPMENT]
- Bone necklace, Shadow Assassin cloak, and Adaptive belt all reforged to blooming. Frag them where applicable
- Gauntlet of contagion with speed attribute (dw about the other one).
- Use nether equipment with speed attribute if you'd like, since it's quite important.

### [WEAPON]
Bouquet of lies, soul eater 3+, melee enchants, smite 7, prosecute, triple strike, syphon...etc. Fabled or suspicious reforge.
[Justification for why bol is better than juju](https://github.com/Notswiftie/swiftieguides/blob/main/guides/why%20is%20bol%20better%20than%20juju.md) (This was written for bouquet of lies against juju, but is quite an old argument - go to the top of the page to read the most updated and strongest,)
(You can skip juju entirely)


### [PET]
Level 90+ legendary giraffe pet (legendary is required)
At 3+ blocks away, it should be 1.4x dps which is insanely good. (You do not need to be 3 blocks away, since one of it perks works universally, but against minis or bosses, you'd have a swing range of roughly 6 holding bol and keeping that range should be a breeze)

Alternatively, you could use lion pet. Lion is better for clear on the roses (since the giraffe 100% extra damage buff, ferocity...etc doesn't apply on the roses) and for dps in case you get hit.


### [MAGICAL POWER AND TUNINGS]
Get good mp. The exact recommended amount is 407 (this is the amount that gives you 82 (maxed) attack speed with two pieces of renowned and 4 digits of secrets. **Do note that GENERALS MEDALLION talisman is needed for this to work.** [Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1yzhdw85v0)

If more attack speed is needed:

**Order of priority for obtaining attack speed - Dungeons**
1) Max end essence shop perk -> Twin headed strike & get renowned reforge on two pieces of armour (e.g. boots and leggings).
2) Itchy magical power reforge + high mp.
3) Enrichments and beacons.
4) Try to avoid tunings as much as possible since you want them to be on speed.
5) COMPLETELY avoid crochet tiger plushie.

### [BERSERKER PRIORITIES (statswise)]
1) 82 attack speed
2) 400 speed (don't lose too much damage in pursuit of this)
3) Damage

_Changes players w/o f7 comp or money: Use 3/4 zombie knight (50% Stat boost - ask someone or use a mod if you don't know what it is, dropped from the highest floor you've completed) or shadow assassin and golden head._
