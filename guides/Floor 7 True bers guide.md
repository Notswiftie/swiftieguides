# Floor 7 True bers guide!
_This guide is intended for players with a f7 completion, but for those without, an alternative setup or method is linked below_

### [ARMOR]
- Maxor’s boots
- Necron’s leggings and chest plate
- Golden head for whatever floor you’re doing
- Max end shop two headed strike perk to buff renowned. It will give 42 attack speed on helmet alone.
  Upgrades: Legion 3, gemstones if can afford, recomb, hot potatos, and basic enchants.
- Reforge: Two pieces of renowned on armour pieces, but the golden head has to be ancient. 

### [EQUIPMENT]
- Bone necklace, Shadow Assassin cloak, and Adaptive belt all reforged to blooming. Frag them where applicable
- Gauntlet of contagion with speed attribute (dw about the other one).
- Use nether equipment with speed attribute if you'd like, since it's quite important.

### [WEAPON]
Bouquet of lies, soul eater 3+, melee enchants, smite 7, prosecute, triple strike, syphon...etc. Fabled or suspicious reforge.
[Justification for why bol is better than juju](https://github.com/Notswiftie/swiftieguides/blob/main/guides/why%20is%20bol%20better%20than%20juju.md) 
(You can skip juju entirely)


### [PET]
Level 90+ legendary giraffe pet (legendary is required)
At 3+ blocks away, it should be 1.4x dps which is insanely good. (You do not need to be 3 blocks away, since one of it perks works universally, but against minis or bosses, you'd have a swing range of roughly 6 holding bol and keeping that range should be a breeze)

Alternatively, you could use lion pet. Lion is better for clear on the roses (since the giraffe 100% extra damage buff, ferocity...etc doesn't apply on the roses) and for dps in case you get hit.


### [MAGICAL POWER AND TUNINGS]
Get good mp. The exact recommended amount is 450 (this is the amount that gives you 82 (maxed) attack speed with two pieces of renowned and 4 digits of secrets. **Do note that GENERALS MEDALLION talisman is needed for this to work.**
If more attack speed is needed:

**Order of priority for obtaining attack speed - Dungeons**
1) Max end essence shop perk -> Twin headed strike & get renowned reforge on two pieces of armour (e.g. boots and leggings).
2) Itchy magical power reforge + high mp.
3) Enrichments and beacons.
4) Try to avoid tunings as much as possible since you want them to be on speed.
5) COMPLETELY avoid crochet tiger plushie.

### [BERSERKER PRIORITIES (statswise)]
1) 82 attack speed
2) 400 speed (don't lose too much damage in pursuit of this)
3) Damage

_Changes players w/o f7 comp or money: Use 3/4 zombie knight (50% Stat boost - ask someone or use a mod if you don't know what it is, dropped from the highest floor you've completed) or shadow assassin and golden head._
