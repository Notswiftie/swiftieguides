# Floor 7 True bers guide!
_This guide is intended for players with a f7 completion, but for those without, an alternative setup or method is linked below_

### [ARMOR]
- Ancient maxor’s boots
- Ancient necron’s leggings and chest plate
- renowned golden head for whatever floor you’re doing
- Max end shop two headed strike perk to buff renowned. It will give 42 attack speed on helmet alone.
  Upgrades: Legion 3, gemstones if can afford, recomb, hot potatos, and basic enchants.

### [EQUIPMENT]
- Bone necklace, Shadow Assassin cloak, and Adaptive belt all reforged to blooming. Frag them where applicable
- Gauntlet of contagion with speed attribute (dw about the other one).
- Use nether equipment with speed attribute if you like, since it's quite important.

### [WEAPON]
Bouquet of lies, soul eater 3+, melee enchants, smite 7, prosecute, triple strike, syphon...etc. Fabled reforge.
[Justification for why bol is better than juju](/Users/lucastang/IdeaProjects/swiftieguides/guides/why is bol better than juju.md) 
(You can skip juju entirely)


### [PET]
Level 90+ legendary giraffe pet (legendary is required)
At 3+ blocks away, it should be 1.4x dps which is insanely good. (You do not need to be 3 blocks away, since one of it perks works universally, but against minis or bosses, you'd have a swing range of roughly 6 holding bol and keeping that range should be a breeze)

### [MAGICAL POWER]
Get good mp. The exact recommended amount is 502 (this is the amount that gives you 82 (maxed) attack speed with renowned ghead and itchy alone) Don’t use /missing as it can miss out on lots of cheap talis.
Reforge talis to itchy power and use speed tunings. (Try to avoid attack speed tunings as much as possible)
If more attack speed is needed:
- Get more mp
- Use enrichments
- Use beacon

### Berserker priorities:
1) 82 attack speed
2) 400 speed (don't lose too much damage in pursuit of this)
3) Damage

_Changes players w/o f7 comp or money: Use 3/4 zombie knight (50% Stat boost - ask someone or use a mod if you don't know what it is, dropped from the highest floor you've completed) and golden head._
