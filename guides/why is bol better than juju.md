# Why bol? (or any other melee build)
_This was written a long time ago. For a more update version (with much more proof and theory) on claymore vs term, see [here]()_
## Part 1: Why is juju  not good?
Everything that makes juju *good*, let it be 3 enemies at once, bouncy arrows et cetera requires you to get a hit on first.
And that's the main issue with juju - it is extremely prone to being sabotaged by stray mobs which just refuse to get hit.
Watch any juju clear clip (obviously not polished and refined specifically for videos) and you will find instances where the clearer has one singular mob (or a few) such as withermancers or fels or zombie commanders which just strafe and strafe and are extremely hard to kill - and if you don't land that hit, you just can't clear it or any mobs nearby unless you put in huge amounts of effort or is very lucky. Neither are optimal in clear.

## Part 2: Angular size and refresh rate
Arrows have an angular size of (checks book) very small. The further away the arrow is, the smaller it is. The same applies for the mob - the further away it is, the smaller its hitbox is on your screen.
Arrows (or juju in this case) also has a very low refresh rate or attack rate of 5Hz.
That means, that when you clear with juju with a puny 5 shots a second at maxed attack speed (which is very hard btw - needs nearly 1k mp with just itchy and renowned on two pieces of armor, maxed), you need to put in a huge amount of effort not only aiming at mobs exactly, but also predicting their movement AND locking your cursor on them due to the slow fire rate (imagine a rifle firing 5 hits per second and a rifle firing 20 - needing only one hit to kill the moving target, which one is easier?)
> This means that Juju is actually heavily taxed by being at range
On the other hand, any melee build has a refresh rate of 20 (tick rate) AND a angular size of 60 degrees (not certain on this number). This is absolutely MASSIVE, and will for NO REASON be outdone by juju or arguably even term. (Although term has a large angular size and has access to salvation and bouncy, which could make them level).

## Part 3: DPS and damage
I don't have exact numbers for dps, and this will also depend **WILDLY** on your own stats and upgrades and setup.
However, I will make some assumptions or assertions.
1) Bol does higher damage per hit than Juju, based on the assumption that it's a melee hit, is buffed fucking crazily by bers class, and has similar damage (obviously worse) than SF which does 3x the damage of term for me.
2) (Not an assumption) Bol ability does 90% of a normal swing without venemous, thunderbolt, or fire aspect.
3) (Not an assumption) A normal swing does 64.9% the damage of a normal swing at t=0 and 63.2% the damage of a normal swing when venomous is capped out.

Bol damage: 4 + 0.9x0.649x3 swings worth of damage per second (x3 comes from ability) = 6.268 swings worth of damage per second
Juju: 5 arrows worth of damage per second. Not only is the unit worth less, the actual value is worth less as well.

Furthermore, Bol has 7 hits per second on the same target (and bounces off to nearby targets as well), which not only triggers lust for blood faster than juju by 40% (making dps on longer lasting targets far greater) but also clears nearby mobs.

_Most certainly, bouquet destroys juju in single hit damage, which in clear, tends to be the most important thing anyway._

### Part 3: Range
*Fourth part of this argument: Range*
As I said earlier in part 2, Juju is punished at ranges, due to the angular size argument. You could also feel this when you need superhuman aim to shoot that far. Arrows are also affected by *gravity* which plays a huge role.  
On the other hand, bol flowers, whilst being punished the same by juju, have no gravity drop off.
Most importantly, due to fels, which you must walk up to and basically kiss, range doesn't matter - you'll have to go there anyways.

### Part 4: Survivability
Bol has higher strength (bers mini baby yeti perk), and heals more than any melee weapon and certainly juju through syphon, bloodlust, and dungeon mechanics.
You literally survive better too.

## TLDR:
Bouquet is better than juju in EVERY WAY, whether it's cost, clear speed, clear comfortability, dps, or survivability.
