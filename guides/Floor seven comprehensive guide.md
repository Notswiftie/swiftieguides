-This guide will attempt to document most, if not all f7 strategies. It will NOT be constantly updated, and I’m in no way the best at f7, or m7. Therefore, if there are any changes,
Let me know, dm or ping me in discord.(user)
This guide will be aimed at more fluent players, but for those who haven’t played before, refer to the overview.
Overview: (This is a simple explanation which will work for the vast majority of parties)

Where and how to practice all of this?
Phase 1: Maxor
In phase 1, you must defeat Maxor, who has 100 million health and no defense. However, he could only be damaged when he is stuck in a powered laser. Therefore, you need to pick up the power crystals on either side of the boss room and place them on the respective pedestals, which powers up the lazer, and let Maxor chase you into it, where you can do up to 75 million damage. You have to do this twice to kill him. After this, the huge floor opens and allows you to fall into phase 2. Optimally, this phase lasts 24-27 seconds, mainly depending on how quickly you can get crystals.
There are 4 main roles in phase 1: These are: Predev (abbrv: PD), Left crystal (abbrv: LC), Right crystal (abbrv: RC), and Aggro. Predev will be explained in more detail in a separate section.

Left crystal and Right crystal:
You grab the left/right crystal twice. This can be done either using a jerrychine gun or a Bonzo staff. A more advanced and more expensive option are the spring boots which also work. Refer to videos below to see how it is done exactly.

You can also do them with spring boots! This is fairly self explanatory, and takes about zero effort and skill.
Survivability issues: It is easy to have survivability issues, but it can be solved EXTREMELY easily with one thing: Speed - if you move quickly enough, the wither skulls CANNOT hit you and you will take almost zero damage, making tank not required.
Agro:
This is done by either tank or archer, and is the most complicated role in this phase. In floor 7, agro is based almost entirely on proximity (applies to Maxor, Storm, and Necron). A summarized order of priority (i.e. who will get agro?) for this is:a
Who’s used these abilities most recently (within the radius)? Jingle bells, tank ultimate (castle of stones), and Enrager
Who is the closest to the wither?
Since (hopefully) no one will be using either of the items in the first priority, the only thing that should matter is proximity.
You want to start under Maxor, and when the wither miners start to spawn a few seconds into the run, or Maxor starts moving, use a jerrychine gun to jump up to 100% guarantee you’re the closest to Maxor, which allows you to take agro. Then, you want to lead him onto the conveyor belt where the laser will be, and you want to stand at the back edge of it where you will not be moved by the belt, and STAND THERE - do not move. Maxor will be at the perfect distance to be struck by the laser when it forms, where he will become attackable.
No matter if you’re tank or archer, your job here is to damage Maxor a reasonable amount. Reason being, if Maxor reaches 25 Million health at any point, he becomes enraged, where he deals a huge amount of damage which can threaten even Cata 50s, where almost anyone would need some evasive maneuver which is more effort or slower. Therefore, when he becomes stuck in the laser, you only want to do between 25-75 million damage (anywhere in between is fine, I prefer just getting him down to 70 million health using a hyp’s right click).
Now you just wait for the other two crystals to be placed down - if they are placed down too slowly, or if someone else deals damage to Maxor and gets him to 25M health, you have to survive (optimally without moving) using the following items: Phoenix pet + autopet rules, spirit mask, gloomlock grimoire, other sources of healing, wither cloak (for a quick second), or just wiggle around (try to avoid this). He won’t be enraged for too long though, so don’t be worried!
When both crystals are placed down and the lazer becomes red/active again, do dps ASAP and kill him.

Phase 2: Storm
In phase 2, you must defeat Storm, the father of Maxor (unfortunately (???) it’s a he), who has 400M health. You spawn in a massive arena with a huge amount of wither miners, in which storm flies around in a circle and fires powerful fireballs at players. After about half a minute, Storm begins his giga lightning, which kills any unprotected people, and becomes freely moving. You must lure Storm under one of the pillars, and have a player crush storm with a pad in the corner, which makes storm damageable and allows you to do up to 50% of its health, so you must repeat this twice. Optimally, this phase takes around 50 seconds.
There are 3 main roles in phase 2: These are: Green pad (abbrv: g, or gpad, or gp), Yellow pad (abbrv: y, or ypad, or yp), and Aggro. (Yes there’s purple-yellow pad, but that will be skipped for now)

Green pad:
Kill as many wither miners as possible, since killing up to around 70 of them increases the speed at which storm travels. (Caps at 70 in total). You can also mostly AFK in this phase since not much needs to be done. Just before giga lightning starts at 26 seconds, you can move to the green pad located in the corner, where you can use a wither cloak to survive the lightning which happens at 30 seconds into the phase. Enable splits, for example from skytils to know when this is. (There’s also a big countdown).
Then, agro will lure Storm towards the green pad. Before Storm gets into the pad (since there is a pretty big delay), stand in the middle 5x5 of the pad to guarantee it triggers, and lower the pad by one increment (AKA once) so that there is a gap between the floor and the bottom of the pillar, which allows you to either have a second consecutive chance at crushing storm or for archer to hit Storm’s feet. After you lower the pillar, you can either wait at the red pad, leap to predev, or go down to phase 3 yourself.
Yellow pad:
Kill as many wither miners as possible, since killing up to around 70 of them increases the speed at which storm travels. (Caps at 70 in total). You can also mostly AFK in this phase since not much needs to be done. Just before giga lightning starts at 26 seconds, you can move to the yellow pad located in the corner, where you can use a wither cloak to survive the lightning which happens at 30 seconds into the phase. Enable splits, for example from skytils to know when this is. (There’s also a big countdown).
Then, agro will lure Storm towards the green pad, where he will be damaged - you don’t need to do anything here. After he loses 50% of his health, agro will lure Storm towards the yellow pad, where you stand in the middle 5x5 and lower the pad. (similar to green but different timings slightly), and leap to predev, wait at red, or do gown yourself.
Extra strat: Prepad - see appendix
Agro:
Kill as many wither miners as possible, since killing up to around 70 of them increases the speed at which storm travels. (Caps at 70 in total). You can also mostly AFK in this phase since not much needs to be done. Just before Thunder Strike starts at 26 seconds, you can move to the edge of the raised platform towards the center of the arena, looking at Storm, and cloak the lightning to survive it.
Since the only thing that matters is proximity, and there is never anyone closer, you can just wait here for Storm to approach you, and you can walk back to behind the pillar (before it’s crushed of course) to trap Storm in it, and then damage him for 200 million health, after which he starts chasing you again. Lead him to the yellow pad, where he is crushed, and you dps him again. After he’s dead (exploding sounds start playing), leap to predev, wait at red pad, or go down to phase 3 yourself.

Phase 3: Goldor
In phase 3, you must run through a series of four sections, whilst being chased by Goldor. Goldor travels at a slow speed. There are four terminals in each section (with the exception of the second section), two levers, and a device. After all four sections have been completed in order, the gate to the core will open, and once everyone is in the core, Goldor moves in, where you kill him.
Everyone plays a significant role in phase 3: The most simple way of organising these roles are in numbers from 1-4, and devs (usually done by predev)
The numbers are ordered in the order of how far they are from the gate you enter from, where 1 is the closest, and 4 is the furthest. If they are very similar horizontally, the lower down one is the lower number.
Each player calls out their terminal number, and for the most part, stick to that terminal for the entire phase (Example: IF I call out 4, I will always do the 4th device)
This is the most important part of the boss fight, as most time is lost/gained here - optimally, it takes about 60 seconds in a decent party and around 42 in the best.
Since this is a complicated phase with lots of improvement space, I’ve added lots of clips in the movement section. These are NOT hyper optimized in any way.
Do NOT shoot Goldor! It is not necessary.
On the following pages, the terminal numbers, terminal locations, device names, device locations, and lever locations for each section is labeled.





Tips and tricks to do this phase faster:
Use good terminal solver mods - Odin or Skytils works quite well for it.
Use Skytils block incorrect clicks
Improve movement speed for your terminal - how quickly can you get from the gate to your terminal?
Make everyone call a term, so there won’t be any missed out.
Movement
The most demanding parts of phase 3 is how you get to your terminals, and due to the distance, I will be covering mostly the 4th terminal and some of the 3rd terminal.
Section 1: Since everyone leaps to predev for this section, movement for all classes is fairly trivial for everyone.
Section 2: This is actually the hardest section, because there are five terminals with lots of obstacles. Therefore, both the 4th and 3rd dev movements are shown below.
Section 2 3rd dev movement
INSERT SECTION 2 4TH DEV MOVEMENT
Section 3: The most complicated movement here would be the 4th device, and there are two main options. One, which is technically harder and faster, going the high route, and another, which is easier and more consistent for some players, going the low route.
Section 3 4th dev high movement
Section 3 4th dev low movement
Section 4: Both the 4th and 3rd devices deserve attention here, so here are the clips uploaded for them.
UPLOAD CLIPS FOR THEM
Early enter (ee):
This is a fairly sweaty trick, where a player enters the next section before the current section ends, so people could leap to them and get to their terminals faster to save time. This is challenging, because you only have between 7-9 seconds to survive, since Goldor instakills you and there’s only two ways to bypass that: Bonzo mask, and phoenix pet.
You want to have Bonzo mask equipped at the start, so that Goldor pops that mask, you use a fishing rod to rod swap to a phoenix pet of the highest level you can get, which gets you up to 9.2 seconds to early enter depending on the Goldor death tick (see: Appendix)
The main forms of ee are ee2 and ee3, which means entering section 2 and 3 early. In the following clips, the clips start at where you might be, and end at where you should be for the healer to leap to you.
EE2 (Early enter 2)
EE3 (Early enter 3)
Slingshot: VNMB (jim)'s slingshot example - medal.tv link
This is used in only the sweatiest of parties (touching on M7 territory), where mage/2nd term enters the core during the second section after doing their terminal, and stays at the 4th section to effectively early enter 4.
This also means that the 2nd terminal in s3 would be missed out, so predev/healer has to do the second terminal and the device. The bers/3rd terminal does the third terminal and tries to do the device too. Afterwards, everyone leaps to mage/2nd terminal person.
I4/Insta 4/pre4:
Another way to significantly boost p3 times is through what’s called I4. This is when someone does the 4th device at the start of p3 within 9.2 seconds, when Goldor kills you. Since you are outside of the phase you should be in, you will be killed by the Goldor death barrier, and just like with EE, you would need a Bonzo mask and phoenix pet with rod swap pet rules.
There are plenty of guides for this on YouTube already, so I’ll link a fantastic one. (it’s aimed at M7 Bers, but adapt it for f7!)
How to pre 4 w/ clicks | Hypixel Skyblock Guide

Phase 4: Necron
Almost everyone except for dps (arch or mage, maybe bers if you’re into that) can AFK here.

Predev
Predev is when a player sets up the devices whilst the party is still in phase 1 and 2 (mainly the align device) so that they do not take up as much precious time in the actual phase 3.
There are two main ways to do this - forwards, and reverse. (There will be different names). Forwards starts from s1, to s2 to do lights device, then to s3 to do align device., and leaps back to p2. Reverse does the opposite - you go past the barrier to enter s4, and go backwards into s3
Personally, I do reverse, which skips the lights device. This is fine, since lights device is relatively fast if you’re confident and have good movement. (The main benefit of reverse is that it’s blisteringly fast - sub 35 seconds) I would however recommend forwards predev for the vast majority of people, since it does the lights device, is easier to learn, and you aren’t time pressured on predev anyways.

Either way, here are four attached videos.
One, the healer guide from irltraded, which is effectively the same role as predev in f7.
The other, by walrt, for forwards predev. (An additional submission by mqx will be there too)
Final one by me, for reverse predev.
SS skip
SS skip is the method used to skip the first few clicks of the first device, or Simon Says. A text description (don’t expect to understand this!): You click the start button twice rapidly, and once more a little after for three in total. Three buttons on the main board then appear, so you click the second and third one that appears. Afterwards, just do the board like normal in order of when they appear. This skips the first bit of the device and therefore a few valuable seconds.
Since that’s a pretty confusing description, here’s irltraded’s healer guide timestamped for the ss skip guide!
